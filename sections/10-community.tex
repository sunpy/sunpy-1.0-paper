\section{Community}
\label{sec:community}

As discussed in \citet{bangerth2013}, a vital component to the long-term success of a project requires building a healthy community of users, developers, and maintainers.
The \sunpyproj has taken a number of steps to nurture and grow the SunPy community.
We have adopted a formal code of conduct\footnote{\url{https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/code_of_conduct.html}} that strives to foster an open, considerate, and respectful environment for all.
Additionally, we maintain a number of active communication channels including mailing lists, real-time chats based on the open source matrix protocol\footnote{\url{https://matrix.org}}, and weekly teleconferences.
SunPy community members have also lead tutorials at national and international conferences, participated in summer programs, and provided mentorship to new members of the community.
Developers and contributors are currently provided credit for their work by authorship on papers, posters, and release notes, as well as awards.
For example, in 2018, Vishnunarayan K. I. was presented an award by NumFOCUS for exceptional contributions to the open source scientific software ecosystem by updating \sunpypkg to use a scientific time class.
