    The primary goal of the \sunpy Project is to facilitate and promote the use and development of a community-led, free and open-source software for solar physics based on the scientific \python environment. 
    This goal is primarily achieved through the development of the \sunpypkg core package which aims to provide foundational capabilities to the community. 
    The Project also supports a number of  affiliated package which depend on the core package. 
    The aim of this paper is to describe the first official stable release (v1.0) of the core package as well as the project organization and infrastructure. 
    This paper concludes with a discussion of the future of the Project.
