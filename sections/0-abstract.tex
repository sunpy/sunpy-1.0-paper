    The \sunpy Project facilitates and promotes the use and development of several community-led, free, and open-source data analysis software packages for solar physics based on the scientific \python environment. 
    The project achieves this goal by developing and maintaining the \sunpypkg core package and supporting an ecosystem of affiliated packages.
    The aim of this paper is to describe the first official stable release (v1.0) of the core package as well as the project organization and infrastructure. 
    This paper concludes with a discussion of the future of the Project.
