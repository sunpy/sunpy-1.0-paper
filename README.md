Scope of the Paper
==================
The purpose of this paper is to describe the upcoming v1.0 release of SunPy,
describe the project, its aims and goals and the infrastructure. It is not
meant to replace or repeat the documentation.

Writing standards
=================
Please follow the following standards. We designed the following guidelines to make the paper easily digestible and accessible for everyone.

*  Use the defined commands in `main.tex`.
*  Do not include code examples.
*  Use the first-person plural ("we") and the active voice. E.g.:
    * active: "the diversity of data sets makes this difficult"
    * passive: "this is made difficult by the diversity of data sets"
    * active: "The SunPy Community et al. (2015) described version 0.5"
    * passive: "Version 0.5 was described in The SunPy Community et al. (2015)" 
*  Avoid overly technical language (like subclass, decorator, namespace, mixin, and factory) wherever possible.
*  Use plain English to reference a piece of code (e.g. "a Pandas dataframe" versus "a `pandas.DataFrame`").
*  Define references to other code whenever reasonable (e.g. "a Pandas dataframe, or a two-dimensional data structure aligned in rows and columns").

LaTeX Formatting
----------------

Please always be strict on having one sentance per line to aid in git diffing and latex error detection.
