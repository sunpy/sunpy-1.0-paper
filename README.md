Writing standards
=================
Please follow the following standards. We designed the following guidelines to make the paper easily digestible and accessible for everyone.

* Use the defined commands in `main.tex`.
* Do not include code examples.
* Use the first-person plural ("we") and the active voice. E.g.:
  * active: "the diversity of data sets makes this difficult"
  * passive: "this is made difficult by the diversity of data sets"
  * active: "The SunPy Community et al. (2015) described version 0.5"
  * passive: "Version 0.5 was described in The SunPy Community et al. (2015)"
* Avoid overly technical language (like subclass, decorator, namespace, mixin, and factory) wherever possible.
* Use plain English to reference a piece of code (e.g. "a Pandas dataframe" versus "a `pandas.DataFrame`").
* Define references to other code whenever reasonable (e.g. "a Pandas dataframe, or a two-dimensional data structure aligned in rows and columns").

LaTeX Formatting
----------------

Please always be strict on having one sentence per line to aid in git diffing and latex error detection.
